## 0. Before You Start: Tell AI What You Expect

When you start a new chat with an AI (or a new conversation), it helps to tell it **how you want it to behave**.

You can copy and edit this:

> “From now on, please act as a  
> - health assistant who can explain things in **plain English** (or Chinese),  
> - familiar with common diseases and how hospitals work,  
> - but **you are not my personal doctor** and cannot replace an in‑person visit.  
>   
> Your main tasks are:  
> 1) Help me **listen and summarize** my symptoms in a clear way;  
> 2) Help me roughly separate things that look **milder** vs. **more worrying**;  
> 3) Remind me whether I **should see a doctor**, what kind of clinic to go to, and what to prepare.  
>   
> Please note:  
> - You **must not give me a final diagnosis**;  
> - You **must not give me exact drug names, doses, and how to take them**;  
> - If you think my situation looks dangerous, please say so clearly and tell me to go to a hospital or call emergency services.”

## 1. One Simple Method to Remember

> **3 sentences to describe your situation  
> + 3 questions to ask AI.**

- **3 sentences**:  
  1) Who you are, and your basic health background  
  2) What feels wrong this time, when it started, and how it changed  
  3) Other symptoms, and what you are most worried about

- **3 questions**:  
  1) Did I explain clearly? Please summarize and check for missing info.  
  2) Do I need to see a doctor? Where? When is it urgent?  
  3) If I go to a doctor, what should I prepare, and how to describe my situation?

---

## 2. Step 1: Use 3 Sentences to Describe Your Situation

### 2.1 Sentence 1 – Who You Are + Basic Health Background

> “I am **[age]** years old, **[male/female]**, currently living in **[country/region, e.g. Mainland China, province, city]**.  
> I have **[high blood pressure / diabetes / heart disease / asthma / or ‘no long‑term illnesses’]**.  
> I usually take **[medicine name + approximate frequency, if you remember]**.  
> I am allergic to **[medicine name, or say ‘no known drug allergies’]**.”

**Example:**

> “I am 45 years old, female, living in Mainland China.  
> I have high blood pressure and take amlodipine. I have no known drug allergies.”

---

### 2.2 Sentence 2 – What’s Wrong This Time + When It Started + How It Changed

> “This time my main problem is **[what: headache / chest discomfort / stomach pain / cough / fever / palpitations / shortness of breath, etc.]**.  
> It started about **[time: 3 days ago, this morning at 8 a.m., etc.]**.  
> Since then it has **[become worse / stayed similar / improved a bit]**.”

**Example:**

> “This time my main problem is chest tightness. It started last night.  
> At first it was just mild discomfort, and now it gets worse when I move around more.”

---

### 2.3 Sentence 3 – Other Symptoms + What You Are Worried About

> “I also have **[fever / nausea / vomiting / diarrhea / dizziness / unsteady walking / slurred speech / difficulty breathing / blood in urine, etc.]**.  
> I am especially worried about **[what you fear most: heart problem, stroke, cancer, etc.]**.”

**Example:**

> “I also feel a bit short of breath, especially when I walk fast.  
> I’m worried this might be a heart problem, like a heart attack.”

---

### 2.4 A Full Example You Can Directly Copy and Edit

> “I am 45 years old, female, living in Mainland China. I have high blood pressure and take amlodipine. I have no known drug allergies.  
> This time my main problem is chest tightness. It started last night. At first it was just mild discomfort, and now it gets worse with physical activity.  
> I also feel a bit short of breath when I walk fast. I’m worried this might be a heart problem, like a heart attack.”

You can send something like this to the AI first, and then ask the 3 questions below.

## 3. Step 2: Ask AI 3 Key Questions

### 3.1 Question 1 – “Please summarize what I said and check if anything is unclear”

**Example prompt:**

> “First, please summarize what I just told you in **simple, plain language**,  
> and tell me if there is any important information I did not mention.  
>  
> Then, **without giving a final diagnosis**,  
> could you briefly describe:  
> - What general directions or systems doctors might consider (for example, heart, lungs, digestion, nerves, etc.)?  
> - Which possibilities are **more common and usually not very serious**?  
> - Which possibilities are **more worrying and may be serious**?  
>  
> For now, please **do not say ‘you definitely have X disease’**.  
> I mainly want you to help me understand and organize the possible directions.”

The goal:

- Let AI help you **check your description** and **fill in missing basic info**;  
- Let it describe **possible directions**, not a final label.

### 3.2 Question 2 – “Do I need to see a doctor? Where to go? When is it urgent?”

**Example prompt:**

> “Based on what you currently understand about my situation,  
> please **roughly** help me assess the urgency:  
>  
> 1) Does it seem more like I should:  
>    - **go to the emergency department now**;  
>    - or **see an outpatient clinic within a few days**;  
>    - or it might be okay to **watch at home for a short time**?  
>    Please explain your reasons.  
> 2) If I should go to a medical facility, would you suggest:  
>    - a **nearby community clinic / primary care center**,  
>    - a **general hospital outpatient clinic**,  
>    - or the **emergency department**?  
>    Please explain why.  
> 3) Please list the signs or changes that would mean  
>    I **must not delay** and should go to the emergency department or call emergency services immediately.”

The AI is only giving **rough guidance**, not a guarantee.  
If things obviously get worse or feel very wrong, you should **err on the side of going to the hospital**.

---

### 3.3 Question 3 – “If I go to a doctor, what should I prepare and how to explain?”

**Example prompt:**

> “If you think I should see a doctor,  
> please tell me:  
> 1) What can I **safely do or avoid** at home before going?  
>    (For example: simple lifestyle precautions, not randomly taking new medicine, etc.)  
> 2) What should I **prepare before the visit**, to make it more efficient?  
>    For example:  
>    - previous test results or health check reports;  
>    - the medicines I am currently taking (bring the boxes or photos);  
>    - simple records of this episode (when it started, how often, any measured blood pressure/blood sugar, etc.).  
> 3) Could you help me write a **short but complete description** of my situation,  
>    so I can read or say it to the doctor, to make it easier for them to understand quickly?”

This lets AI help you become a **clear communicator** when you see a doctor.

## 4. Extra Question for People with Chronic Diseases

If you already have a chronic condition (e.g. high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, asthma), you can also ask:

> “I have **[name of chronic disease]**.  
> In the last period of time:  
> - my blood pressure / blood sugar has been around **[a few recent numbers]**;  
> - I have / have not had symptoms like dizziness, chest discomfort, palpitations, low blood sugar feelings, etc.;  
> - recently I **have / have not** missed doses, stopped medication, or changed doses on my own.  
>  
> Can you help me整理this into a **short summary** that I can say to my doctor during the visit?”

## 5. When You Should *Not* Ask AI First, But Go to a Hospital

In the following situations, you generally **should not spend time chatting with AI first**.  
You should **go to a hospital or call emergency services immediately**:

- **Sudden severe chest pain or chest tightness**, especially with obvious breathing difficulty or a bluish face/lips.  
- **Sudden slurred speech, facial drooping, weakness on one side of the body, unsteady walking, or sudden loss of vision.**  
- **Large amounts of bleeding** (vomiting blood, black or bloody stool, heavy vaginal bleeding, major trauma with bleeding, etc.).  
- **High fever (e.g. ≥ 39°C) with very poor mental state, confusion, or rash/purple spots.**  
- **Severe shortness of breath, unable to finish a sentence without pausing for breath.**  
- **Serious trauma** (car accident, fall from height, head injury), especially with fainting or seizures.  
- **Snake bites, suspected serious poisoning** (pesticides, gas, large amount of medicine, suspicious food, etc.).  
- **Pregnancy or postpartum with severe headache, seizures, heavy bleeding, or severe breathing difficulty.**  
- **Infants or children who look very ill: poor response, gray or bluish skin, labored breathing, very little urine.**

> In these situations:  
> **Call emergency services or go to a hospital first.  
> Do not stay at home chatting with AI while time is critical.**

## 6. Privacy and Safety Notes

- When describing your situation to AI, **do not include**:
  - real name, ID number, phone number, full home address, workplace, etc.  
- If you upload or paste parts of medical reports, consider **covering or deleting** names and ID numbers.  
- Remember:  
  - AI is **not legally responsible** for your care;  
  - important decisions (hospitalization, surgery, prescriptions, etc.) must be made by real doctors.

## 7. Ultra-Short Version (You Can Save in Your Notes App)

When you feel unwell and want to ask AI, you can copy this and fill in the blanks:

> “Let me briefly explain:  
> I am **[age]**, **[male/female]**, with **[chronic conditions, or ‘none’]**, taking **[medicines, or ‘none’]**.  
> This time, my main problem is **[what feels wrong]**, starting from **[when]**. It has **[gotten better/worse/stayed similar]**.  
> I also have **[other symptoms]**. I’m most worried about **[what you fear]**.  
>  
> Please first **summarize my situation in plain language**,  
> and tell me if I missed any important information.  
> Then, in simple terms, please tell me:  
> 1) What general directions doctors might consider (you don’t have to give a final diagnosis, just common and worrying possibilities);  
> 2) Does it look more like I should go to the emergency department now, see a clinic within a few days, or can observe at home for a short time?  
>    And in what situations must I go to the emergency department or call emergency services immediately?  
> 3) If I go to see a doctor, what should I prepare and how should I explain my situation more clearly?”

> If you can remember:  
> **3 sentences to describe + 3 questions to ask**,  
> and **go to a hospital first when there are obvious danger signs**,  
> you are already using AI in a responsible and helpful way.

## 8. Final Reminder

- AI **can** help you:
  -Organize information, clarify thoughts, translate technical terms, and prepare questions to ask the doctor.  
- AI **cannot**:
  - provide a definitive diagnosis,  
  - decide what medicine you should take,  
  - replace in‑person medical care.

**The real decisions about your health must be made by licensed doctors who see you in person.**
