## 1. What is this repository?

This repo contains **two sets of practical templates** for asking medical questions to AI:

- For **patients / general public**  
  - Help you describe your symptoms more clearly.  
  - Help you ask AI about possible directions, urgency, and how to prepare for a doctor visit.

- For **primary care / frontline doctors**  
  - When facing **acute, severe, unclear, or high‑risk cases**,  
    AI can be used as a “thinking assistant”:  
    - broaden differential thinking,  
    - check for blind spots,  
    - reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and treatment delay.

## 3. Quick start

### 3.1 For patients / general users

Simple rule:

> **3 sentences to describe your situation + 3 questions to ask AI.**

See: [`PATIENT_GUIDE_en.md`](./PATIENT_GUIDE_en.md)

You will find copy‑and‑edit templates for:

- Describing who you are and what you feel  
- Asking “Do I need to see a doctor? Where should I go?”  
- Preparing information and questions before a clinic visit

### 3.2 For primary care doctors

Core idea:

> **First explain your own thinking,  
> then ask AI to think wider, challenge you, and prioritize risks.**

See: [`DOCTOR_GUIDE_en.md`](./DOCTOR_GUIDE_en.md)

It includes:

- A suggested “AI role” prompt for first use  
- How to briefly present a case to AI  
- Three key actions:  
  - let AI think broadly, beyond your initial diagnosis  
  - explicitly ask AI to “argue against” your current thinking  
  - ask AI to sort risks by severity and urgency  
- Plus: scenarios where AI should **not** be used (resuscitation, massive bleeding, etc.),  
  and basic privacy / data protection tips.
